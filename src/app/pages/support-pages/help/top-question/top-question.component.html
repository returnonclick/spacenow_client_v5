        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <span>The terms for rental will be agreed between yourself and your host. We know everyone’s needs are different, that’s why there’s real flexibility for hosts and renters in terms of rental period. We have spaces available for hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or even longer rent. It really is down to your needs and the discretion of your host..</span>
