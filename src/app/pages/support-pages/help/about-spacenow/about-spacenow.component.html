          <p class="heading-text">Why should I rent from Spacenow instead of the big coworking spaces? </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <span>Spacenow lists a variety of spaces from dedicated desks to function rooms. Our hosts also range from big coworking spaces to everyday people and workers who have unused space and would like to meet new people. Finding a space with us means a greater variety in terms of location and prices.</span>

      <span>Definitely! Here at Spacenow, we want you to be able to share any unused space you have. Have a spare kitchen, car space, function space, clinic room? List it with us! We have extensive categories available online, someone somewhere is looking for the space you have.</span>
