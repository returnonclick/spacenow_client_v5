        2. Use of the Service. The Host warrants, that if it is using the Service on behalf of a company, other entity or organisation 
        it is acting on behalf of and authorised to bind that company, entity or organisation to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
        In particular but without limiting the warranty, that it has the right to grant a licence for the Space on the terms of a Space 
        Licence Agreement. The Host agrees to respond promptly and completely to requests for any additional information from Spacenow that 
        it in its sole discretion deems necessary to confirm it has the authority to bind and act on behalf on that other party’s behalf. 
        In addition to the termination provisions of the Terms of Use, Spacenow may also terminate your access to the Service if it has 
        reason to believe that you have breached this warranty and do not have the requisite authority. <br> <br>

    <li>
      
        3. Transactions Between Guests and Hosts for Booking Space. Any agreement between a Host and a Guest is in the terms of the Space 
        Licence Agreement, or such other licence agreement as the Host and the Guest enter into and that it is not a party to that agreement.

        requirements, building codes and any other applicable requirements;<br>
        b) The Space is clean, tidy and ready for use at the start of any Reservation;<br>
        c) The booking of the Space through the Service does not violate any lease, mortgage, or other agreements relating to or secured
