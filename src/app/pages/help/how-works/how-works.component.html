        <span>The easiest way to find a Space is using our search function.

Don’t stress, we’re adding new listings daily. Check back regularly to see if your dream space has been listed with us. </span>

      <span>Once you have submitted your listing and it has been approved, it’s completely up to potential renters to contact you. We can’t put a definitive time frame on it and that’s why we don’t charge you for listing with us! Advertise your space for as long as you would like. We definitely recommend a catchy title and high quality images to better attract potential renters. </span>

      </mat-panel-title>
      <span>Don’t worry, many of our hosts are quite busy and may not have the time to reply to your enquiry immediately. Unfortunately, due to demand of spaces sometimes you may not be able to obtain the space you would like. We list a variety of spaces and recommend you look for several options with us. </span>

      </mat-panel-title>
      <span>Unfortunately not. Due to demand, many spaces are popular and not every potential renter will get the space they initially wanted. Submitting an enquiry serves as an expression of interest from you to the host about the space they have listed but it doesn’t guarantee you to the space!</span>

Want to block of specific times for your space availability? Simply communicate this in your space description or use the exceptions section if you’re using our booking system. </span>
