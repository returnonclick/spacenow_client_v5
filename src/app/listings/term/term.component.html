1.    Documents and Dictionary. We are unable to set out the arrangements you may enter into through our Site in one document. We have created a Dictionary of the terms we use throughout our documentation. These agreements include Host Terms and any Space License Agreement. The link to the relevant agreement will appear when you use a particular Service.

2.    Services. The services we provide comprise an online platform through which a Host may create listings for Spaces and a Guest may learn about and book Spaces directly with the Host.

3.    Spacenow Not a Party. You understand and agree that Spacenow is not a party to any agreements entered into between a Host and a Guest, nor is it acting as a real estate agent, broker or insurer even if Guest and Host use the agreements provided on this Site for the arrangements between them. Spacenow has no control over the conduct of Host, Guest and other Users and disclaims all liability in this regard.

4.    Payment. All payments are in accordance with the Payment Terms.

5.    Confidentiality. You agree that if you enter into any agreement as a Host or a Guest that during the Term and thereafter, Confidential Information will not at any time be disclosed to any person by the recipient of that information, nor used for such recipient’s own benefit or the benefit of any third party without the prior written express consent of the party who owns such Confidential Information. You agree that if you breach this obligation, we or the person who owns the Confidential Information shall have the right to request any remedy in law and/or equity including, but not limited to, appropriate injunctive relief or specific performance, as may be granted by the appropriate court. As a Guest you will accept all risk to your intellectual property, interest in using the Space and that neither the Host, nor the owner of any Building shall have any liability arising from, disclosure (whether intentional or not), or any of your intellectual property or Confidential Information to any third party.

6.    Non-Solicitation. None of the Host nor Guest, nor their representatives, employees and agents shall knowingly solicit, recruit, hire or otherwise employ or obtain the employees of the other during the Term and this restriction will remain in force for 180 days following its termination or expiration without the prior written consent of the other party.
